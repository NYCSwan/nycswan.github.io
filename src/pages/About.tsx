          My career has always been driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and a
          desire to make a meaningful impact. With a background in software
          development, community outreach, and organizational management,
          I&apos;ve built solutions, streamlined operations, and connected
          people with the resources they need. But when I became my
          father&apos;s caregiver, my perspective on work and purpose shifted.
          That experience reinforced my strengths in adaptability, empathy, and
          creative problem-solving â€” skills that naturally align with senior
          care. I am passionate about creating beautiful, functional, and
          meaningful experiences online and in person.

          After more than 6 years as a software engineer, finding solutions for
          complex real life problems using technology, I took on an additional
          role, as a caregiver for my dad who had developed memory issues. It
          was a challenging and rewarding experience. I have experience working
          on a variety of projects, from web and mobile apps to IoT. I love
          working with all types of teams. If it exists, I have probably worked
          with(in) the organizational structure -- startups to agencies and even
          non-profits! I most recently tried my hand as a startup founder after
          having a caretaker

          Now, I&apos;m channeling that expertise into creating engaging,
          enriching experiences for older adults while continuing to develop
          software projects that improve accessibility and quality of life. I
          thrive at the intersection of technology and human connection, using
          strategic thinking and hands-on collaboration to support both
          individuals and organizations. Whether through program development,
          technology solutions, or direct engagement, I&apos;m committed to
